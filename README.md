# Nautilus-RT
I'm attempting to create a standalone real time system from an existing aerokernel named Nautilus. The motivation behind this project is to create a highly deterministic method for processing. Deterministic processing can eliminate the need for extraneous and costly synchronization calls. It could provide an outlet to decrease power during determined idle periods. It could run hard real-time embedded systems that require a lightweight OS. There are a plethora of reasons to experiment with real-time, and it's fun!  (See https://bitbucket.org/kchale/nautilus for details on Nautilus)
